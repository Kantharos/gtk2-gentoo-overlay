MATE-DESKTOP 1.12
=================

This is an overlay intended to be used in Gentoo. It is based
on packages by gentoo upstream Maintainer (NP-Completeass) and pacakges
by Alex (from the now gone open-overlay).

I have done my best to adhere to Gentoo's best practices, however, there
are a few things you should consider before you use this overlay:

 * Mate is AWESOME, but I do this on my free time
 * I am not an official developer (though, I hope to become one)
 * I did my best to test all ebuilds (with `repoman` and with installing
   them on my machine), but I could not possibly test all use flags.
  - I didn't try GTK3 support
  - I don't use systemd, hence I didn't test it

If you find this work useful, you can do one of the following:

 * Install and use these package. Give me usefull feedback
 * Star this repository.
 * Tweeter me with a thank you.
 * Buy me a Beer\Bier\cerveza\bière\insert your language here, while
   in FOSSDEM 2016
 * Donate me a humlbe sum of 2-5€ to help me finance my trip to FOSSDEM 2016.
   (Donations should go to oz dot tiram _at_ gmail dot com),
   I'll mention you here for supporting my work.
